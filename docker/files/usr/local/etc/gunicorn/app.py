# Handler that forces Gunicorn to print the current stack trace, when its worker timeoutâ€™s.
# This can happen when a request hangs waiting for an external service dependency, like when a
# database is too slow or can't connect to the S3 Bucket provider. The worker receives the SIGABRT
# signal from the Gunicorn parent process and this handler runs before the worker it stopped.
